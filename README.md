## BillProject

BillProject is a nameless piece of software used by tenants or those in flat shares, it is used for the tenants to share bills with each other, allowing users the ability to make partial payments and notify each other about payment that have to be made.


## Why?

I personally feel that living in a shared house hold can be difficult, this helps save those awkward conversations and keeps track of your current payments and bills, i'm tired of consumers focusing on households rather than individuals. BillProject lets you split that bill.


## Installation

This project is still in the early stages and once a stable application has been created it will be available online in the shape of a web application.


## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
